2025-10-04,average,"Moderate wind and cool temperatures, with a full moon, suggest average fishing. Water is slightly warmer than air.",Consider slower presentations and bottom-bouncing lures. A steady retrieve might work best. Focus on areas with cover and structure.,7.6671373119208175,99.95584911204428,4.546767648748136,Full Moon,8.28207727097602
2025-10-05,average,"Moderate conditions. Water is slightly warmer than air, and full moon can influence feeding. Wind is manageable.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. Target areas with structure or drop-offs. Light to medium tackle will suffice.,8.132502419454614,99.95630173058115,4.436432350273771,Full Moon,8.980681013002876
2025-10-06,average,"Cool air temp, but slightly warmer water is decent. Full moon may push fish deeper.",Focus on slower presentations near the bottom. Consider jigs or soft plastics. Look for areas with structure or weed beds.,8.573645723804876,99.92040301536613,4.350946993256124,Full Moon,9.528451655806979
2025-10-07,average,"Cool temperatures and moderate wind are present. Full moon may influence fish activity, but water is slightly cooler than air.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or crankbaits. Focus on deeper water where temperatures may be more stable. A moderate action rod with spinning or casting reels will be versatile.,8.732874750353218,99.8693740990422,4.2926238141752755,Full Moon,9.754982603459466
2025-10-08,average,"Cool air and water, moderate wind, and full moon suggest decent but not optimal conditions. Pressure is stable.",Consider slower presentations with finesse baits or jigs. Focus on areas with structure or deeper water. Light to medium tackle should suffice.,8.76395615941999,99.83689983268144,4.294476900841767,Full Moon,9.621267726456106
2025-10-09,average,"Moderate temperature and wind. Full moon might affect fish behavior, potentially leading to deeper feeding.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. Deeper water or structure might hold fish. Use a sensitive rod to detect subtle bites.,8.893427427718489,99.83262042323862,4.3021436670547075,Full Moon,9.746184023502627
2025-10-10,average,"Mild temperatures and moderate wind are okay, but the last quarter moon may reduce activity. Water is slightly warmer than air.",Consider targeting deeper water where fish may be less affected by lunar phases. Slow presentations with soft plastics or jigs could work well. A sensitive rod will help detect subtle bites.,9.124308785397602,99.96088382504263,3.731902519264952,Last Quarter,9.58493776676369
2025-10-11,average,Cooler air temps and moderate wind are average for this water temp. Last Quarter moon might slightly affect feeding.,Focus on mid-depth structures. Consider jigs or soft plastics. A steady retrieve should work well.,9.213821897103402,99.96269597700771,3.73401825731455,Last Quarter,9.71052616971053
