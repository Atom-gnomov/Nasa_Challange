2025-10-04,average,"Cool air and water, mild wind, and a full moon suggest moderate activity, favoring calmer conditions.",Focus on bottom-feeding or slower-moving presentations. Consider using natural baits or jigs. Patience will be key for success in these conditions.,8.316839676898155,100.72122516912108,2.4098622076687795,Full Moon,9.169033712566304
2025-10-05,average,"Cool air and water temps, coupled with a full moon, suggest cautious fish. Moderate wind is manageable.","Target deeper, sheltered areas with finesse baits. Consider slower retrieves. A light to medium spinning setup will be versatile.",8.775053712531209,100.52711925679043,2.3930653244487514,Full Moon,9.840183645191857
2025-10-06,average,"Water is slightly warmer than air, and pressure is stable, but the full moon might make fish more wary.",Try slower presentations near cover. Consider finesse baits or jigs. Early morning or late evening may be best.,8.983986916072356,100.3429404954437,2.3840092422047663,Full Moon,10.205245613014645
2025-10-07,good,"Moderate temperatures and stable pressure are favorable. The full moon might stir some nocturnal activity, but daytime fishing is still promising.",Focus on slower presentations near structure. Consider soft plastics or jigs. A 6-8 lb test line on a spinning combo should work well.,9.32813376735692,100.2126774262934,2.384562792894789,Full Moon,10.61220025578946
2025-10-08,good,"Moderate temperatures, stable pressure, and a full moon suggest good activity, especially at dawn/dusk.","Focus on areas with cover, as fish may be more spread out. Consider soft plastics or lipless crankbaits. A moderate retrieve speed should work well.",9.428623867850202,100.0997057240549,2.385616509280722,Full Moon,10.445157544595016
2025-10-09,good,"Stable, moderate pressure, and comfortable water temps suggest good activity. Low wind is a bonus.",Target transition zones with jerkbaits or crankbaits. Consider finesse techniques if bites are tentative. Focus on early morning and late evening periods.,9.643470669321767,100.0549382865362,2.385802786655514,Full Moon,10.661712396099546
2025-10-10,average,Cool temperatures and last quarter moon suggest moderate activity. Water is slightly warmer than air.,Try slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near the bottom. Consider a medium-action rod and reel setup. Watch for subtle bites in the cooler water.,9.320010433821016,100.145543775957,2.1486327424354204,Last Quarter,10.079644775830316
2025-10-11,average,Cool temperatures and a waning moon suggest moderate activity. Stable pressure and slight wind are favorable.,Focus on bottom-bouncing presentations or slow retrieves with soft plastics. Consider crankbaits in warmer pockets. Light to medium tackle is suitable.,9.463315113185791,100.13205865618426,2.148600774638671,Last Quarter,10.250300599741626
