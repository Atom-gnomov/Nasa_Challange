2025-10-05,average,"Moderate conditions: cool air, slightly warmer water. Full moon may influence activity, but wind is manageable.",Focus on bottom-bouncing lures or soft plastics. A slower retrieve may be beneficial. Consider fishing near structure or drop-offs.,8.562823389088178,100.59274882565111,3.7571357859603203,Full Moon,9.60394729259926
2025-10-06,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, with a full moon, suggest a decent bite, but moderate wind might limit casting.",Focus on slower presentations near the bottom. Consider jigs or soft plastics. A moderate wind might require a heavier lure for casting.,9.024138854588058,100.55756035064978,3.697523218339917,Full Moon,10.07747779577392
2025-10-07,average,"Moderate air and water temps with full moon offer decent conditions. Pressure is stable, but light wind may limit scent dispersion.",Try reaction baits like crankbaits or jerkbaits. Consider scent attractants for slower presentations. A medium action rod will handle various species.,9.29733677621825,100.51137093228344,3.649805564005781,Full Moon,10.355839679134649
2025-10-08,average,Cool air and water temperatures suggest moderate fish activity. Wind is present but not excessive. Full moon may influence feeding.,Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. Stick with medium or medium-heavy tackle. Focus on deeper areas or structure where fish may seek comfort.,9.369166595129316,100.48606230926502,3.6918479610074564,Full Moon,10.283766592265067
2025-10-09,average,Cool temperatures and a full moon offer mixed signals. Moderate wind is manageable.,Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. Focus on deeper water or near structure. Light tackle will be most sensitive.,9.490004491799903,100.49554180692607,3.7939268163501003,Full Moon,10.423377447115875
