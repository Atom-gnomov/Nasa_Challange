2025-10-05,average,Water is slightly warmer than air. Full moon can trigger feeding. Moderate wind is acceptable.,Consider slower presentations near the bottom with jigs or soft plastics. Spinnerbaits or crankbaits might also work. Focus on early morning or late evening.,8.562823389088178,100.59274882565111,3.7571357859603203,Full Moon,9.60394729259926
2025-10-06,average,Cool water temps and moderate wind offer average fishing conditions. Full moon might increase activity.,Focus on slower presentations near the bottom. Consider jigs or soft plastics. A medium-heavy setup will be versatile.,9.024138854588058,100.55756035064978,3.697523218339917,Full Moon,10.07747779577392
2025-10-07,average,Moderate temperatures and wind are present. Full moon might influence feeding patterns.,Try crankbaits or soft plastics near structure. A medium rod with 8-12lb line is suitable. Consider fishing during dawn or dusk.,9.29733677621825,100.51137093228344,3.649805564005781,Full Moon,10.355839679134649
2025-10-08,good,"Water temperature is ideal, and stable pressure supports active feeding, despite the Full Moon potentially making fish a bit more cautious.",Focus on bottom presentations or slower retrieves in shallower areas. Consider finesse baits or jigs. Light line and sensitive rods will be beneficial.,9.369166595129316,100.48606230926502,3.6918479610074564,Full Moon,10.283766592265067
2025-10-09,average,Cool temperatures and a full moon offer mixed signals; moderate wind is manageable.,Consider fishing near dawn or dusk for increased activity. Employ subsurface lures or jigs. A medium-weight spinning setup is versatile.,9.490004491799903,100.49554180692607,3.7939268163501003,Full Moon,10.423377447115875
2025-10-10,average,"Cool temperatures and moderate wind are not ideal, but stable pressure and close water temperature offer some potential for fish activity.",Focus on slower presentations in deeper water. Consider jigs or soft plastics. Lighter lines may improve lure action in the cool conditions.,8.926884041890016,100.65314604470991,3.6204641139983775,Last Quarter,9.897792402308896
2025-10-11,average,Cool water and moderate wind are acceptable. Last Quarter moon can bring steady feeding. Pressure is stable.,Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. A medium-action rod with monofilament line works well. Watch for subtle bites in cooler conditions.,9.025457003869473,100.65587322592468,3.616369460315267,Last Quarter,10.00482711573021
2025-10-12,average,Cool temperatures and moderate wind suggest average fishing. Last Quarter moon can stir activity.,Focus on slower presentations near structure. Consider jigs or soft plastics. Use a slightly heavier line for potential tougher bites.,9.091816317843493,100.65775681727754,3.61376763856714,Last Quarter,10.074095022188395
