2025-10-05,average,"Cool, but not cold, water with moderate wind. Full moon might influence feeding. Pressure is stable.",Consider slower presentations and natural colors. Employ a sensitive rod for subtle bites. Look for structure or deeper water.,10.772334957826757,102.110997065987,4.803037826270511,Full Moon,11.579785177898223
2025-10-06,average,"Moderate wind, cool air, and full moon are mixed factors. Water temp is okay for some species.",Try jigs or soft plastics near structure. Consider early morning or late evening. Be patient; bites might be subtle.,10.922914369586117,101.88357633644549,4.764794292735411,Full Moon,11.577735106133789
2025-10-07,average,Moderate temperatures and stable pressure suggest fair fishing. Full moon might influence activity.,Try suspending baits or jigs near structure. A medium action rod with 8-10lb test line should suffice. Consider fishing during dawn or dusk periods.,10.882890298403955,101.72050606619639,4.792349968689131,Full Moon,11.561968560656517
2025-10-08,good,"Slightly cooler air than water, moderate wind, and a full moon suggest good fish activity and feeding opportunities.",Target deeper areas or weed lines. Use minnow imitations or finesse baits. A steady retrieve with occasional pauses can be effective.,10.949228639578553,101.5818419106692,4.820368313219231,Full Moon,11.457249515194047
2025-10-09,good,"Moderate temperature, stable pressure, and full moon suggest good fishing conditions, with slightly choppy water from wind.",Try crankbaits or soft plastics that mimic baitfish. Consider areas with cover for calmer water. A medium action rod and reel will handle varied conditions.,10.870524867880842,101.5084697390443,4.805143214574027,Full Moon,11.458282904719786
2025-10-10,average,"Moderate temperatures and wind, with stable pressure and last quarter moon, offer decent fishing opportunities.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics. A medium-action rod with 6-10 lb test line is suitable. Focus on structure and deeper water.,11.097185351902967,101.4357485199076,5.071804410478286,Last Quarter,11.645646239839605
2025-10-11,average,"Moderate wind, stable pressure, and cool water indicate average fishing conditions. Moon phase may slightly affect feeding.",Try slower presentations with jigs or soft plastics. Consider a finesse setup. Fish near structure as feeding windows may be shorter.,11.035398715445739,101.40942892338175,5.0602941178957925,Last Quarter,11.660123370470684
2025-10-12,average,"Cool air and water temps, moderate wind, and a last quarter moon suggest fair fishing conditions. Fish might be slightly lethargic.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near cover. A sensitive rod will help detect subtle bites. Be prepared for changing light conditions.,11.08933571854181,101.38945897069519,5.059145017474881,Last Quarter,11.663627994013815
