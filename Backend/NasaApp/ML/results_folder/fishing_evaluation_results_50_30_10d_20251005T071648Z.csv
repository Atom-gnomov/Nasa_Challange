2025-10-05,average,"Cool temperatures and moderate wind are present. Full moon may slightly increase activity, but water is still cool.",Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics fished near the bottom. A medium-action spinning rod with 6-10lb line is suitable. Fish early morning or late evening when light is low.,7.502214070086208,99.96031643177837,3.8388739217886965,Full Moon,8.819705433781193
2025-10-06,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, coupled with a moderate wind and full moon, create an average fishing scenario with potential for good bites.","Focus on deeper water or structure where fish may seek refuge from the cool. Try slower presentations with jigs or soft plastics. A full moon can sometimes lead to aggressive feeding, so don't be afraid to experiment with brighter colors.",8.060975574282956,99.93192866131116,3.859041963746904,Full Moon,9.39322392209501
2025-10-07,average,"Cool air and water temps, combined with moderate wind, offer decent, though not ideal, fishing conditions.","Focus on slower presentations and deeper water. Consider jigs, soft plastics, or blade baits. A moderate retrieve will likely be best.",8.284252378490295,99.88680089370935,3.8530314119346736,Full Moon,9.629408548752497
2025-10-08,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, combined with moderate wind, create average conditions. Full moon may influence fish behavior.",Focus on slower presentations with jigs or soft plastics near the bottom. Consider early morning or late evening. A steady retrieve with crankbaits could also work.,8.34932820661738,99.85847467869971,3.873592257855,Full Moon,9.501806718080823
2025-10-09,average,"Moderate temperature and wind, with a full moon, suggesting decent but not prime fishing conditions. Water is slightly warmer than air.",Focus on transitioning areas with good structure. Consider slower presentations with jigs or soft plastics. A moderate action rod and braid line will be effective.,8.403236253495301,99.8573445887518,3.9084811538018247,Full Moon,9.592453758358143
2025-10-10,average,"Cool air and water, moderate wind, and a last quarter moon suggest average fishing conditions. Pressure is stable.",Focus on bottom presentations like jigs or live bait. A moderate retrieve with crankbaits might also work. Consider warmer times of day.,7.754338417422019,100.00478604074262,3.6821400404025972,Last Quarter,9.040564225819523
2025-10-11,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, combined with a last quarter moon, suggest moderate fishing conditions. Moderate wind may stir up baitfish.",Try slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near cover. Consider a moderate retrieve for crankbaits. Dress warmly as temperatures are cool.,7.855001399490336,100.00746049738257,3.6814555360813888,Last Quarter,9.166097139349713
2025-10-12,average,"Cool air and water, with moderate wind, suggest average fish activity. Last Quarter moon might influence feeding patterns.",Focus on subsurface presentations like jigs or soft plastics. Consider slower retrieve speeds. A sensitive rod will help detect subtle bites.,7.922035859048641,100.0093019744452,3.680979453317089,Last Quarter,9.244656492417445
