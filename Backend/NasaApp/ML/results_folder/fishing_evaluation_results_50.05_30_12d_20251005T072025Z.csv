2025-10-05,average,Cool temperatures and moderate wind are okay. Full moon might slightly increase activity. Water temp is still a bit chilly for peak fishing.,Try slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near structure. Consider a slightly warmer micro-habitat. Patience is key in these conditions.,7.502214070086208,99.96031643177837,3.8388739217886965,Full Moon,8.819705433781193
2025-10-06,average,"Cool air and water, moderate wind, and a full moon are neutral to slightly positive for fishing activity.",Focus on bottom-bouncing lures or bait near structure. Consider a moderate retrieve speed. A 7-foot medium-action rod and reel combo would be suitable.,8.060975574282956,99.93192866131116,3.859041963746904,Full Moon,9.39322392209501
2025-10-07,average,"Moderate temperatures and a full moon offer decent fishing, though wind might be a slight factor.",Try slower presentations near structure. Medium-action spinning gear with finesse baits could be effective. Consider fishing near dawn or dusk for best results.,8.284252378490295,99.88680089370935,3.8530314119346736,Full Moon,9.629408548752497
2025-10-08,average,"Cool air and water, moderate wind, and a full moon suggest fair fishing, potentially better at dawn/dusk.",Try slower presentations with soft plastics or jigs near structure. Consider suspending baits. A moderate retrieve with crankbaits could also work.,8.34932820661738,99.85847467869971,3.873592257855,Full Moon,9.501806718080823
2025-10-09,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, coupled with a full moon, suggest moderate fish activity, though wind could be a factor.",Consider slower presentations with jigs or soft plastics near structure. A moderate wind might call for slightly heavier lures. Waterproof gear is recommended due to the cool conditions.,8.403236253495301,99.8573445887518,3.9084811538018247,Full Moon,9.592453758358143
2025-10-10,average,"Cool air and water temperatures, with a moderate wind, suggest average fish activity. Last Quarter moon can influence bite patterns.",Focus on slower presentations and deeper water. Consider soft plastics or jigs. Dress warmly and be prepared for variable conditions.,7.754338417422019,100.00478604074262,3.6821400404025972,Last Quarter,9.040564225819523
2025-10-11,average,"Cool air and water temps, moderate wind, and last quarter moon suggest average fishing conditions. Pressure is stable.",Focus on slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near cover. Consider a medium-action rod. Dress warmly and check water clarity.,7.855001399490336,100.00746049738257,3.6814555360813888,Last Quarter,9.166097139349713
2025-10-12,average,"Cool air and water, along with a moderate wind, suggest average activity. Last Quarter moon can influence bite times.",Focus on slower presentations near cover. Consider jigs or soft plastics. Light to medium tackle is suitable for these conditions.,7.922035859048641,100.0093019744452,3.680979453317089,Last Quarter,9.244656492417445
