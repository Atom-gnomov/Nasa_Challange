2025-10-05,poor,"Cold air and water temperatures, combined with moderate wind, suggest sluggish fish behavior and difficult casting conditions.",Focus on slower presentations near bottom structure with finesse baits or jigs. Consider fishing closer to shore or in sheltered coves. Dress warmly; conditions are challenging.,1.6177596445481028,101.02554007244322,5.276903163793262,Full Moon,3.5905349098645583
2025-10-06,poor,"Cold air and water temperatures, coupled with moderate wind, will likely make fish sluggish. Full moon might add some activity, but overall conditions are challenging.","Focus on slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near structure. Consider warmer, deeper water if accessible. Dress warmly and prioritize safety.",1.5599537454454855,101.10079701802348,5.659216901360407,Full Moon,3.736227878094077
2025-10-07,poor,"Cold air and water, combined with moderate wind, suggest low fish activity. A full moon may offer a brief feeding window.",Focus on slow presentations with finesse baits near deeper structure. Consider scent attractants. Warmer midday periods might be best.,1.4964522272862362,101.15050970030268,5.619325238218905,Full Moon,3.848618096659002
2025-10-08,poor,"Cold air and water temperatures, coupled with moderate wind, suggest sluggish fish. Full moon may offer some late activity.",Focus on slower presentations with finesse baits near structure. Consider thermal refuges like deeper water or near-shore structure.

2025-10-09,average,Cold air and water are offset by stable pressure and a full moon. Wind is moderate.,Consider slower presentations like jigs or soft plastics near structure. A warmer day might improve activity. Dress warmly and check wind direction.,1.3784421522434358,101.20949278875676,5.319059567783455,Full Moon,4.005611423094215
2025-10-10,poor,"Cold air and water temperatures, combined with moderate wind, will likely make fish less active. Last Quarter moon offers some bite potential.","Focus on slow presentations with finesse baits near structure. Consider warmer, shallower areas. Dress warmly and use a reliable reel for cold conditions.",2.0418760656725325,100.92538050589793,5.254513401978727,Last Quarter,4.557132729776589
2025-10-11,poor,"Cold air and water, combined with moderate wind, will likely slow fish activity. Last Quarter moon has minimal impact.","Target deeper, warmer water if possible. Consider slow-moving baits like jigs or soft plastics. Dress warmly and fish during the warmest part of the day.",2.0235351394054057,100.92840646306041,5.377662318095528,Last Quarter,4.597758623251656
2025-10-12,poor,"Cold air and water, combined with moderate wind, suggest sluggish fish. Last Quarter moon typically offers less active feeding.","Focus on bottom-fishing techniques with slow-moving baits. Consider areas with structure or deeper, warmer pockets. Opt for sensitive rods to detect subtle bites.",2.004631172966036,100.93024127496409,5.421833763476662,Last Quarter,4.629050595867058
2025-10-13,poor,"Cold air and water temperatures, along with moderate wind, will likely make fish lethargic and challenging to locate.","Consider targeting deeper, slower-moving water. Employ slower presentations with soft plastics or jigs. Dress warmly and be patient.",1.9897281932506345,100.93135382697362,5.417846889448192,Last Quarter,4.653321598067012
